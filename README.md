# OVH to Google Colab and Amazon SageMaker Studio Compatibility Mode

The purpose of this docker image is to make it easy to run 
Jupyter Notebooks authored on 
Google Colab or Amazon SageMaker Studio
on the OVH AI Notebook infrastructure.
For example, this allows you to try out
those Huggingface Transformers Examples
in a private european Cloud.

# How to update

In your target environment, run
```
!apt list --installed
```
and copy the result into `package-list.txt`.
Afterwards, run 
```
!pip3 freeze
```
and copy the result into `requirements.txt`.

In the Dockerfile, update the CUDA and cudnn versions on top,
as needed to match the package list.

Run `packagelist2apt.py` 
to create an updated `apt-install.sh`
out of your package list.
