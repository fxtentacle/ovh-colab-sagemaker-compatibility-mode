# OVH to Google Colab and Amazon SageMaker Studio Compatibility Mode

The purpose of this docker image is to make it easy to run 
Jupyter Notebooks authored on 
Google Colab or Amazon SageMaker Studio
on the OVH AI Notebook infrastructure.
For example, this allows you to try out
those Huggingface Transformers Examples
in a private european Cloud.

# How to update

In your target environment, run
```
!apt list --installed
```
and copy the result into `package-list.txt`.
Afterwards, run 
```
!pip-chill
```
and copy the result into `requirements.txt`.
Move large requirements such as torch or TensorFlow
into `requirements-large.txt` so that you 
don't have to reinstall them in case of version conflicts.

In the Dockerfile, update the CUDA and cudnn versions on top,
as needed to match the package list.

Run `packagelist2apt.py` 
to create updated `apt-install-*.sh` scripts
out of your new package list.
